title=[B41] Server Tips & Alerts System
description=This mod displays helpful tips, server rules, and bug notifications to players through an elegant popup system that adapts to gameplay conditions.
description=
description=[h1]How it works[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Message source (no coding required):[/b] A simple text file holds all messages. If it doesn't exist, the mod creates it with default messages.
description=[code]Zomboid/Lua/TipsAndAlerts/TipsAndAlerts.txt[/code]
description=[*] [b]Versioned updates:[/b] The [i]first line[/i] is a version string (e.g., [i]VERSION = 1.1[/i]). Change it when you edit messages to trigger updates.
description=[*] [b]Safe display logic:[/b] Popups wait if zombies are nearby when on foot. While driving, popups can still show so you don't miss info.
description=[*] [b]Randomized cadence:[/b] Messages appear at random intervals within your configured range.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h1]Singleplayer & Server behavior[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Singleplayer:[/b] Reads directly from your local file and checks for changes about every minute.
description=[*] [b]Multiplayer:[/b] The server manages the message list. Clients sync on connect and when updates are available (the server scans periodically, roughly every 10 minutes).
description=[*] [b]No restart required:[/b] Edit the file, bump the version, and updates are pushed to players.

description=
description=[h1]Key features[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Context-aware placement:[/b] Above hotbar on foot; above dashboard in vehicles.
description=[*] [b]Smooth presentation:[/b] Configurable fade-in/out and on-screen duration.
description=[*] [b]Zombie safety radius:[/b] Delay popups near zombies (configurable; set to 0 to always show).
description=[*] [b]Rich text formatting:[/b] Colors, headers, alignment, sizing, and line breaks.
description=[*] [b]Priority alerts:[/b] Supports high-priority popups (used by optional integration below).
description=[*] [b]Lightweight:[/b] Minimal performance impact.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h1]Optional integration[/h1]
description=[list]

description=[b]Syntax for the Tips & Alerts System[/b]
description=[code]
description=<LINE> - Starts a new line, resetting the X position of the text to 0 and moving the Y position down by one line height
description=<BR> - Similar to <LINE>, but it creates a larger space between lines, effectively creating a double line break
description=<H1> - Formats text with H1 properties, making it centered and setting the font to large
description=<H2> - Formats text with H2 properties, aligning it to the left and setting the font to medium
description=<TEXT> - Resets text properties to defaults for the body text, using a smaller font than headers
description=<CENTRE> -  Aligns the text to centre
description=<LEFT> -  Aligns the text to left side
description=<RIGHT> -  Aligns the text to right side
description=<SIZE:small/medium/large> - Changes the font size to small, medium, or large (choose only 1 option)
description=<RGB:1.0,1.0,1.0> - Sets the current text color to the specified RGB in the interval 0.0-1.0
description=<RED> - Sets the current text color to red
description=<GREEN> - Sets the current text color to green
description=<BLUE> - Sets the current text color to blue
description=<ORANGE> - Sets the current text color to orange

description=[h1] Frequently Asked Questions: [/h1]
description=
description=[h2]Does it work in Multiplayer?[/h2]
description=Yes. The server distributes messages to all connected clients and pushes updates when the version changes.
description=
description=[h2] Does it work on existing saves? [/h2]
description= Yes! You can enable it mid-save without any issues.
description=
description=[h2]Will popups interrupt combat?[/h2]
description=When on foot, popups wait if zombies are within your configured safety radius. In vehicles, popups may still display so you don't miss info.
